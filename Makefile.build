# This Makefile is copied from the cgreen top directory (where it is
# named Makefile.build) and put in a subdirectory called 'build' where
# Cmake out of source builds are made. This Makefile then
# automatically creates subdirectories for C and C++ builds
# configuring them using the cmake command. Once created you can
# always tweak the cmake setup as with any cmake build directory.
